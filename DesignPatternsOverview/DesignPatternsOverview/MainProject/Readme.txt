/**
OO Design Patterns - Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides

** interface = object + behaviors for inheritance



Focus:

** Creational **

Abstract Factory (Kit) - Creates an interface for subclasses to inherit
Factory - Creates an interface with an option for subclasses to inherit


** Structural **

Adapter - Convert interface of one class into another interface; vertical method overloading
Composite - Compose objects into tree structures
Decorator - Extends functionality dynamically; without inheritance


** Behavioral **

Observer - One-to-many dependency between objects; notify and update relative to state change
Strategy - Define a set of algorithms, encapsulate each one, makes them interchangeable; independent for varying clients 
Template method - Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation
